Dataset: 
Details on NBA injuries from 2010-2011 season through 2018-2019 season. Dataset is scraped from Pro Sports Transactions (url: https://www.prosportstransactions.com/basketball/Search/SearchResults.php?Player=&Team=&BeginDate=&EndDate=&ILChkBx=yes&Submit=Search&start=15425).

Shot Chart data: this was downloaded to the PSTAT 134 repository.

Project Overview:
We will analyze data from the NBA, particularly data on injuries, shot chart data, and traditional stats (position, minutes played, points, steals, rebounds, etc) of every player over the past 10 seasons. We will use our data to observe trends in injuries, such as pertaining to different types of players based on position and play style. Play style can be deduced from shot chart data, which tells us how a player plays on offense, and defensive statistics, which tell us how aggressive a player is on defense. Furthermore, we will attempt to find variables that factor into player injuries. These variables may include player position, play styles derived from short chart data, how many minutes they play, how aggressive they are on defense (steals, blocks, tips, defensive rebounds), and more. We will also dive into observing injury trends over the course of an entire season, for example to see if injuries happen more frequently in the beginning or towards the end of a season, or in which quarter of a game that injuries occur the most. 

The goals of this project are to use statistics from the NBA to try to draw correlations between player injuries and the characteristics, tendencies, and usage rate of players.
